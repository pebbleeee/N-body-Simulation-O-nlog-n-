# N-body-Simulation-O-nlog-n-
Worked with teammates on a GPU-accelerated 2D Barnes-Hut N-body simulation using CUDA. Achieved major speedups over the naive O(NÂ²) method. Performance tested with up to 1M particles; analyzed CPU quadtree bottlenecks and proposed GPU-based spatial indexing improvements.
